# QEA 3 Mini Project 1 Proposal

1. Which project are you doing? If choosing Option 3, what system are you investigating?
Project 2 (floatovoltaics)

2. What are you investigating in particular?

If you are doing Option 4a, choose the set of exercises you plan to complete. We understand these may change, but your initial plan will allow for feedback on scope.
For all other projects, explain your approach and what independent and dependent variables you will be investigating. (E.g., if doing the solar house, perhaps you are varying the materials of construction to find the most cost-effective insulation that still makes the house comfortable.)
3. [Skip this question if doing Option 4a.] How are you going to model the system? Start answering this question by telling us the following: 

What is flowing (where "flowing" may be loosely defined) in your system that will help you determine system behavior?
What will the system's main ODE (or ODEs) be about? (E.g., if it's going to be of the form dy/dx+P(x)y=Q(x),what are y and x?)
What type of ODE (order/linearity/homogeneity) do you expect? Are there multiple, coupled ODEs? 
4. What do you hope to learn from this project? You might consider both quantitative and non-quantitative skills.

5. When will your group do this work? We'd like to see both milestones/deadlines and specific times you are planning to work together. Note: We will dedicate some (but not all) time during each class to unstructured project work.

6. Do you have any concerns about this project? If so, what will you do to mitigate those concerns? Is there anything you need from the teaching team?
